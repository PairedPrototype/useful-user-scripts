# Useful User Scripts

Just a collection of userscripts I've written to add features to various websites, mostly for convenience reasons üòÅ.

## How do I use these scripts?

Easy! You just grab a user script extension like TamperMonkey for either [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) or [Chrome](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=chrome). Don't have either of these? No worries, TamperMonkey is built for other browsers too, see if yours is listed on the [TamperMonkey download page](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
