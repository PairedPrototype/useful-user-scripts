# Useful User Scripts

Just a collection of userscripts I've written to add features to various websites, mostly for convenience ðŸ™‚.

## How do I use these scripts?

Easy! You just grab a user script browser extension like TamperMonkey for either [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) or [Chrome](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=chrome). Don't have either of these? No worries, TamperMonkey is built for other browsers too, see if yours is listed on the [TamperMonkey download page](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

After that, just click your chosen scripts below to install:

- Amazon user scripts
  - [take me to amazon smile always](https://github.com/PurplProto/useful-user-scripts/raw/master/src/scripts/amazon/take-me-to-amazon-smile-always.user.js) - Redirects you to the Amazon Smile domain if you find yourself on the normal site. I'm not sure why Amazon can't just support charities anyway, but here we are, needing a more convenient way to help us do that.
- Reddit user scripts
  - [copy short link](https://github.com/PurplProto/useful-user-scripts/raw/master/src/scripts/reddit/copy-short-link.user.js) - Adds a button in the share menu on (new layout) Reddit posts to copy the short link (https://redd.it/example) instead of the super long link.
